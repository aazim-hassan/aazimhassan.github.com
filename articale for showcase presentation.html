<h1>Things about me:</h1> 

<p1>My name is Aazim and I go to Brian public school. I do two programs called Tks and AAP. AAP is a program where you learn Math and English at a high level. And TKS is a program where you learn about things that you usually don't learn in school, for example, the problems that we humans face and how we can use other types of technology. And in the program, we aim for excellence and try to make the best of our selves.</p1>

<h1>A probleme that i am working on now is space exploration:</h1>  

<p>As we know that there are astronauts that are in space right now and exploring it now but we can only explore 2% of it because if try and do more it is bad for our health and it is impossible to explore it. So I am trying to see how we can use nanotech to make robots which not only go to space but explore it and send the information to earth.</p>

<h1>My solution with nanotecknolodege </h1>

<p1>I was thinking that we could use nanotech to solve this problem. By using nanotech we can make robots which can handle any type of weather or conditions like space.</p1>

<h1>what is nanoteknoloedege?</h1>

<p1>imagine something we use every day like a glass of water. what does it do? well as we know it holds water. but on the bad side when it falls it breaks and the water comes out of it.

what if I told you that we can make the glass to not break and not spill. well, we can in doing so we will just need to move the atoms around and see what works. there is only one problem the atoms are very small even the naked eye can not see it.</p1>

<h1>what are atoms?</h1>

<p1>atoms are thing what every single object is made out of as hard as a robot and as simple as a shirt.</p1>

<h1>what are some companies that are trying to help with this problem and what have they created?</h1>

<p>Some of the companies are Nasa, SpaceX, and many others. <p1/>

<h1>somethings about these two companies:</h1>

<h1>NASA and their mission</h1>

<p1>NASA is a government agency that was created by Congress in 1958. NASA's mission is to explore space and aeronautics, or flight research. NASA is also responsible for making sure that the United States space program is conducted for peaceful purposes that can help mankind.
</p1>

<h1>What is spaceX's goal</h1>

<p1>SpaceX's goal is to designs, manufactures, and launches advanced rockets and spacecraft. The company was founded in 2002 to revolutionize space technology, with the ultimate goal of enabling people to live on other planets.</p1>
